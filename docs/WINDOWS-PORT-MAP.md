# Windows portability map (W0.2A)

The full Windows programme contract, `WGO-WIN-SPEC-2`, is owner-authorized
external material and is not distributed with this repository. This document
is the sole in-repository executable authority for the current portability
classification and `PR-W0.2A` file-lock migration boundary.

W0.2A adds only portable file-lock primitives and migrates the initial four
authority-critical owners: config, menu-app singleton, monitor state, and
source inventory. It does not enable Windows source discovery, key acquisition,
database reads, monitor writes, attachments, backup, tray UI, autostart,
packaging, or message sending. Existing macOS entrypoints and behavior remain
authoritative.
MCP message sending is now retired across platforms; `mcp_server.py` remains
only as an optional legacy read-only compatibility surface.

## Classification

- `windows-import-safe`: imports in a fresh Windows Python 3.11 process. This
  is an import claim only, not a Windows behavior or release-tier claim.
- `deferred-w0.2`: blocked by direct or transitive POSIX lock, path, atomic
  publication, or private-storage ownership. W0.2B owns path identity, private
  storage, and atomic-publication completion after this bounded lock migration.
- `deferred-w1+`: import work is possible, but source/product activation is
  owned by W1 or a later phase.
- `macos-only`: current macOS shell, packaging, or adapter. It is intentionally
  excluded from the Windows import gate until its owning platform PR.
- `operator-deferred`: thin operator entrypoint whose dependencies or behavior
  are not authorized on Windows in the current phase.

`tests.windows.test_portability_inventory` enforces exact coverage of every
root, `ai/`, `core/`, `ui/`, and `scripts/` Python module and imports every
`windows-import-safe` module in a fresh process on Windows.

## Staged cutover

1. **W0.2A:** implement macOS/Windows file-lock backends and migrate only
   `core/config.py`, `core/app_runtime.py`, `core/monitor_state.py`, and
   `core/source_inventory.py`. This phase is source portability, not product
   activation.
2. **W0.2B:** complete path identity, private-storage enforcement, and atomic
   publication on Windows; migrate the remaining authorized storage owners.
3. **W0.3:** adapt secrets behind the contract. Notifications, target opening,
   tray behavior, packaging, and logon startup remain W6.
4. **W1.1–W1.3:** extract the canonical WeChat source contract, add one
   exact-build Windows probe/schema profile, and add a verified key provider.
5. **W2–W6:** enable read-only source, knowledge, resources, backup, then tray,
   packaging, and logon startup only after their separate live gates.

Direct `fcntl` ownership removed in W0.2A: `core/config.py`,
`core/app_runtime.py`, `core/monitor_state.py`, and `core/source_inventory.py`.
Direct application-level `fcntl` remains intentionally deferred in attachment,
resource capture/backup, taxonomy migration, Google Drive file sync, and the
macOS-only source guard. The canonical macOS lock backend necessarily retains
its native `fcntl` implementation.

No module changes classification merely because it imports. The owning phase
must supply its behavioral tests and acceptance evidence first.
